## 🧩 Usecase
Download all the lesson materials from "https://ukey.uludag.edu.tr/". The semester finished and you want to download all the lecture-notes and slides? Normally you would click each download link, Create folders for each class, Rename the files (adding the week-number). That is just too much work to do. Not anymore! 

</br>

## ✨ Features
- Downloads all the lecture-notes and slides assosiated with your student-number
- Creates a subfolder for each class
- Renames the files to ASCII and adds the given week-number.

</br>

## 🧑🏻‍💻 How to use
For now there is only a working release for Windows
### Windows
1. Download the zip-file from releases
2. Extract the zip-file
3. Double-Click on run.exe
4. Enter you student-number and password
5. The downloading process will take between 5-10 minutes

That's all! Enjoy

You don't need to install any python package. You don't even need python. Just a working Windows machine will get you going!

</br>

## 🐍 Used Python libraries
- selenium (simulates a browser)
- pyinstaller (creates the .exe file which includes python and all the packages)
