You don't need to install any Python packages, all dependencies are packed into one executable! You don't even need the Python interpreter installed. Just a working Windows machine will get you going!

### GNU/Linux

1. Download and install [python](https://www.python.org/) if you haven't already (preferably v3.9)
2. Resolve dependency selenium by running command ```pip install selenium```
3. Download and install chrome (google-chrome or chromium)(preferably v97)
4. Download and place [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) executable to /usr/bin
> Important Warning: Do not use ChromeDriver major version 98 as it has issues regarding special characters. Use of v97 with Chromium v98 is tested 
5. Clone the repository to your local with 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hruzgar/ukey-downloader.git
```
6. Install ukey-downloader by running the installer script with ```./install.sh```
7. You should be able to find ukeydl on your applications-list now. If you are not using any window manager just run ukeydl which you can find at /usr/local/bin/ukeydl


## üêç Dependencies for developing
- selenium (simulates a web client)
- pyinstaller (creates the Windows executable which includes Python interpreter and all the dependencies)

## ü§ùüèª Contributing
